# Real-time Injection of Simulated FRBs into SPOTLIGHT

This repository contains the soft copy of the conference poster presented at **FTSky: A program in the field of Fast Radio Transients** (ICTS 2025). The poster is titled:

**"Real-time injection of simulated FRBs into SPOTLIGHT"**

## Contents
- **FRB_8bit_injection_prob_formula.pdf**: Contains the mathematical derivation of the injection methodology, including a general probability shift formula based on the strength of the injected signal.
- **raghav_ftsky_poster.pdf**: The main poster as presented at the conference.
- **References.txt**: A text file listing all references cited in the poster.
- **Plots/**: A directory containing figures and plots used in the poster.

## About

The poster describes a method for injecting simulated Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in real-time into the SPOTLIGHT pipeline, enabling robust testing and validation of transient detection algorithms.
